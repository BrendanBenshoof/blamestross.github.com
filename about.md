This is my semi-anonymous blog.

I am a Computer Science PHD Student, specializing in Network Security and Distributed Computation.

The blog exists so that I can quietly leak the things I learn and invent to the General Public with minimized backlash.

I am really enjoying my low paying GRA position, and would never entertain any Job or Business Ideas sent to blamestross@gmail.com (be sure to use PGP)


# Why BlameStross?


Blame Stross for all of this.

Reading the speculative fiction of [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/) at an impressionable age doomed me to the task of trying to make the good parts of his possible futures come true. It is his fault that I and many like me are trying so hard to change the status quo of security on the internet.
